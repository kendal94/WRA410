# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

Lizzie Kendall

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. I changed almost all of the background colors of pages and divs to white. There are some divs that I left because I felt the gray was the best choice for the design.

2. I imported 'Roboto Slab'(headers) and 'Raleway'(body) from google fonts. I wanted accessible fonts that weren't boring, and google fonts is a great way to get universal, free fonts.

3. For images, I made a 'logo' with a Michigan state picture that stays static throughout the pages. Since my site's color scheme was based on the green in this photo, I decided to keep theme going. I added a Sparty image on the policies page.

4. I used a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page. I didn't do anything fancy because I thought it would be more useful in a clean, easy to read presentation.

5. In order to reformat the Student Groups. I made  links a different color, gave each group a title, and made sure each student's name stood alone. I used multiple columns for the divs, which gives a grid like format.

6. Navigation was added to the Schedule webpage, along with my 'logo' and a uniform h1 that moves seamlessly between pages.

7. For the Schedule webpage, I thought that the date tab took up too much space, so I reduced it to 10%. I then inserted breaks in between the week number and dates so use up the space left in the date block. I also added labels, because I was confused what the columns were when I first viewed the page.
